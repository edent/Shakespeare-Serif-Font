## TODO

* Get more sample images from the 1st Folio.
* Extract more letters, numbers, ligatures, and symbols.
* Sort symbols into sub-directories.
* Generate font with complete alphabet.
* Tidy up curves.
* Set correct height, ascenders, descenders, etc.
* Make the ligatures automatic.
* Other font stuff that I haven't even thought of yet!
